                <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 bg-slate-500 m-4 p-4">
                    <div class="gap-4">
                        <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked
                            applications. A RESTful API is an API that adheres to the principles and constraints of
                            REST.</p>
                        <p>Key principles of REST:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information
                                needed to understand and process the request.</li>
                            <li>Client-Server Architecture: There is a clear separation between the client
                                (front-end) and the server (back-end).</li>
                            <li>Uniform Interface: The API should have a consistent and uniform way of interacting
                                with resources through standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.</li>
                            <li>Resource-Based: Resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource
                                Identifiers), and they can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Example of a REST API request:</p>
                        <img src="./images/rest-api.png" alt="">
                        <p>In this example, a GET request is made to retrieve user data with the ID 123. The URI
                            /api/users/123 uniquely identifies the resource (user) to access. <br>

                            A typical REST API will have endpoints for different resources (e.g., users, products)
                            and use HTTP methods to perform operations on these resources (e.g., GET to retrieve,
                            POST to create, PUT to update, DELETE to delete). <br>

                            Here's a simplified JavaScript code snippet that makes a GET request to a REST API using
                            the Fetch API:</p>

                        <p>This code sends a GET request to retrieve user data and handles the response asynchronously.
